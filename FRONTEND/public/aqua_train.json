Any integer that is a multiple of 2 is an even number. So, q must be a positive even integer.\nWith these two observations, the question can be simplified to:what is the units digit of 4 raised to an even positive integer?\nThe units digit of 4 raised to an integer follows a specific repeating pattern:\n4^1 = 4\n4^2 = 16\n4^3 = 64\n4^4 = 256\n4^(odd number) --> units digit of 4\n4^(even number) --> units digit of 6\nThere is a clear pattern regarding the units digit. 4 raised to any odd integer has a units digit of 4 while 4 raised to any even integer has a units digit of 6.\nSince q must be an even integer, the units digit of p=4^q will always be 6. Consequently, the remainder when p=4^q is divided by 10 will always be 6.\nIn case this is too theoretical, consider the following examples:\nq=2 --> p=4^q=16 --> p/10 = 1 with a remainder of 6\nq=4 --> p=4^q=256 --> p/10 = 25 with a remainder of 6\nq=6 --> p=4^q=4096 --> p/10 = 409 with a remainder of 6\nq=8 --> p=4^q=65536 --> p/10 = 6553 with a remainder of 6\nAnswer: B.", "correct": "B"}
